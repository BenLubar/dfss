Dwarf Fortress simulator simulator
==================================

[Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/) may be the greatest game
ever, but there are a few problems. It requires a window manager, making it hard
to play on a headless server over SSH. It also requires you to manage the
dwarves by yourself.

DFSS aims to solve both these problems: There are no dependencies on outside
libraries (at runtime), it can be played over SSH, and it works on its own. No
interaction and/or thinking necessary!
